# When a direct dependency scope conflicts with a transitive dependency scope, the direct dependency scope always wins.
# When the scope of the transitive dependency is updated, this update needs to be considered by scope inheritance.
# In the graph below gid:a:1 has a conflict, after its resolution to test scope, gid:x:1 should end up in
# test scope as well, everywhere in the graph.
