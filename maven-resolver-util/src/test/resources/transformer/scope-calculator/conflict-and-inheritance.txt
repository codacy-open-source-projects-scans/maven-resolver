# Another scenario to check that scope inheritance considers the effective scopes of parent nodes as determined during
# scope conflict resolution. In this example, gid:x:1 should end up in compile scope (and not runtime) because its
# parent gid:c:2 will be promoted to compile scope due to a conflict with gid:c:1.

gid:root:1
+- gid:a:1 compile
|  \- gid:c:2 runtime
|     \- gid:x:1 compile
\- gid:b:1 compile
   \- gid:c:1 compile
